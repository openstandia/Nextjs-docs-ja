-> Konnyaku is "Konjac" in English
-> Konjacbot

# Purpose

To update translations of the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) in near real-time and effortlessly.

# Overview

- [Detecting Differences](./diff.mts)
  - Retrieves differences from the [Next.js repository](../../next.js) incorporated via git submodule.
- [Translation](./translate.mts)
  - Translates files detected as differing using the OpenAI API.
- [Document Modifications](./mod.mts)
  - Modifies the MDX format so it can be correctly displayed in [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
- [Image Downloading](./dlimg.mts)
  - Downloads images from the [public site](https://nextjs.org/docs) as they are not managed in the Next.js Git repository.
- [Creating Pull Requests](./pr.mts)
  - Creates a branch in this repository and submits a Pull Request with the translated content.
