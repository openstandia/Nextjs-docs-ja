# Konjacbot

A bot that performs translations using AI.

"Translation" is "Honyaku" in Japanese
-> "Honyaku Konnyaku" (Â©DORAEMON)
-> Konnyaku is "Konjac" in English
-> Konjacbot

# Purpose

To update translations of the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) in near real-time and effortlessly.

# Overview

- [Detecting Differences](./diff.mts)
  - Retrieves differences from the [Next.js repository](../../next.js) incorporated via git submodule.
- [Copy Files](./cp.mts)
  - Copies or deletes files with detected differences from the Next.js repository.
- [Translation](./translate.mts)
  - Translates files identified as differing using the OpenAI API.
- [Document Modifications](./mod.mts)
  - Modifies the MDX format for proper display in [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
- [Image Downloading](./dlimg.mts)
  - Downloads images from the [public site](https://nextjs.org/docs), as they are not managed in the Next.js Git repository.
- [Creating Pull Requests](./pr.mts)
  - Creates a branch in this repository and submits a Pull Request with the translated content.

### Execution (using tsx)

```bash
npx tsx run ./scripts/konjacbot/diff.mts [options]
```

Options:

```
-o : File path to output the execution result.
-a : Flag to detect all document files as differences instead of `git diff` results.
```

Example:

```bash
npx tsx run ./scripts/konjacbot/diff.mts -o ./my-diff.txt
```

### Execution (using npm script)

```bash
npm run kj:diff
```

This is an alias for:

```bash
npx tsx ./scripts/konjacbot/diff.mts -o .kj-diff.txt
```

### Output File Format

The output format is identical to the result of `git diff --name-status`.

Example:

```txt
A  docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/03-layouts-and-templates.mdx
A  docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/04-linking-and-navigating.mdx
```

### Description

- Update the submodule with `git submodule update --remote`.
- Obtain submodule differences with `git diff --name-status` and output the results.

## [Copy Files](./cp.mts)

### Execution (using tsx)

```bash
npx tsx run ./scripts/konjacbot/cp.mts <path to diff file>
```

```

### Execution (using npm script)

```bash
npm run kj:cp
```

This is an alias for:

```bash
